## Summary of Initial Project Proposal
### Project Idea
The objective of this project is to create a webpage that serves as a tool for users to host, create, manage, and participate in in-person fantasy football drafts.

### Purpose
The purpose of the project is to provide football fans with a tool that can be used to host, create, manage, and participate in in-person fantasy football drafts.
By providing this platform, fantasy football fans are able to use the tool to aid in the organization, managment, and overall enjoyment of in-person drafts. 

### Functionality
The webpage will enable a virtually hosted draft, mimicking the traditional physical properties of an in-person draft. This allows for the commissioner and team managers to create teams, populate them, view the remaining players, and track drafted players. The webpage will share information about each player such as player position, team, bye week, ADP, and other relevant statistics. Through this added functionality, team managers will be better equipped to make strategic draft decisions. 

### Planning
* **Front-End Development:** The front-end user interface will be designed using React and will uphold best practices to provide the user with a pleasant draft experience. Class components such as App.js, DraftBoard.js, AvailablePlayerList.js, and TeamManagement.js will be used to build different sections of the webpage.
* **Back-End Development:** The back-end will be integrated using NodeJS. NodeJS will be used to develop and access the required APIs for the draft tool and subsequently populate a database with active players in the NFL.
